# JBuild CLI

The [JBuild](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/jbuild) CLI.

JBuild is a Java build system written in Java. This is JBuild's CLI, which is a wrapper around JBuild that uses a
YAML configuration file to control JBuild's command and inputs/outputs, as well as the
[Dartle Task Runner](https://github.com/renatoathaydes/dartle/), which makes sure that only work that needs to be
done is actually done.
